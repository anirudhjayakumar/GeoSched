# GeoSched

GeoSched: Minimizing Cost of Cloud Workloads in Geo-Distributed Data Centers.

We present GeoSched, a job provisioning framework that is workload aware, energy-aware and cooling-aware. GeoSched considers the latency sensitivity of the incoming jobs, electricity pricing of the region and cooling techniques used in the data center to schedule jobs on different data centers. To evaluate our scheme, we perform extensive simulations on real-world workload traces.
